This repository contains css and javascript used to change the look and feel of the UC eLinks page. 

This code consists of a download of the UC eLinks page and supporting assets. "index.html" and "sfxmenu_overrides.css" contain the stylesheet and javascript changes necessary to amend the UI.

This code is intended to provide a prototype for how the UI and navigation could be changed.  It is not intended as production code.  

In addition, this code may be useful as an example of how to us css and javascript to alter the UI of an html page that makes heavy use of nested tables for layout.
