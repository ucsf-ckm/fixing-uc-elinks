**Disclaimer:** This is a quick-and-dirty prototype for how the UI and navigation could be changed.  It is not intended as production code. 

Sample UC eLinks page with additional CSS and JavaScript to enhance functionality and improve usability.

* `index.html` is a scrape of `http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_ucsf?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rfr_id=info:sid/sfxit.com:azlist&sfx.ignore_date_threshold=1&rft.object_id=1000000000237899&rft.object_portfolio_id=` that'll run locally.
* `sfxmenu_overrides.css` contains the added CSS.
* `ucsf_overrides.js` contains the added Javascript.
